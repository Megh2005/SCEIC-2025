      <p>
        Considering the enormous scope of Civil Engineering, this conference
        covers a wide range of discipline and expertise. Evidently the Civil
        Engineering has been very much contributing to human development and the
        quality of life through the provision of infrastructure. However, on the
        other hand, those infrastructural developments may cause environmental
        degradation. Therefore, in recent times, the role of Civil Engineers is
        to progress the infrastructure development process towards
        sustainability, which has become more important than before. Along with
        the main theme, the conference will also cover other important aspects
        in Civil Engineering and its allied branches. The conference is being
        organized with main focus to address the future of Civil Engineering
        practitioners, innovation and sustainability requirements. It
        facilitates a platform to present ideas and discuss future R&D
        requirements that would enhance sustainable development in the field of
        Civil Engineering.
